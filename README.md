This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the price of used cars. A large dataset is used that includes information about thousands of used cars, including make, model, year, mileage, condition, and price. The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on these and other factors.
